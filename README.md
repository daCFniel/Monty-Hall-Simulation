# Monty-Hall-Simulation
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem demonstrates the counterintuitive nature of conditional probability.

This repository contains a Python simulation of the Monty Hall problem to explore the odds of winning if switching doors vs. not switching doors after the initial door selection.
