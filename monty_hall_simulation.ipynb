    "The results of the simulation show that the player has a higher chance of winning the car if they switch their choice, rather than sticking with their initial choice. The probability of winning if switching is 2/3 while the probability of winning if staying is 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical justification for the results is that when the player makes the first choice, there are three possible doors, one with the car and two with goats. The player's first choice has a 1/3 probability of being the car. When the presenter opens one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat, there is a 2/3 chance that the car is behind the remaining door, because there is a 2/3 chance that the car was not behind the player's first choice. Therefore, by switching, the player increases the probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3."
